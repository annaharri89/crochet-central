# Crochet Central

Instructions
You will need to have the latest version of Xcode installed. I believe it's free
in the Mac App Store. Once you have Xcode installed, double click on the 
CrochetCentral.xcodeproj file. Once the project is open, click the "Run" 
button in the upper left corner. Make sure that the iPad 2 simulator is 
selected (also located in the upper left corner). 

The app is very outdated and does not work as it originally did, but it is a proof of experience in Objective-C.
